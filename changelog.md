## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-25

### Added

**Core System**
- Complete AI Operator system for GitHub Copilot workflow optimization
- Three flexible installation types: Chatmodes only, Agents only, or Both
- Dual workflow support: Chatmode workflow and Direct agent workflow

**Agent System** 
- 8 specialized AI agents: Orchestrator, Setup, DEV, Code Review, Testing, ADO, Product Owner, Scrum Master
- 18 command templates for structured workflow execution
- Complete agent persona definitions with clear role boundaries

**Chatmode System**
- 15 GitHub Copilot chatmodes (8 workflow + 7 helper chatmodes)  
- Chatmodes embody agent personas for integrated workflow experience
- Orchestrator chatmode for workflow guidance and selection

**GitHub Integration**
- Automatic context loading via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- Manual context access through `.github/instructions/` prompt files
- VS Code settings auto-configuration for optimal prompt file usage

**MCP Integration**
- Built-in support for Sequential Thinking, Context7, and ADO MCP servers
- Automatic MCP configuration during installation
- Template-based MCP setup for custom servers

**Installation & Setup**
- Interactive installation script with comprehensive options
- Automatic file placement and directory structure creation
- Project type detection (greenfield vs brownfield) 
- Post-installation validation and verification

### Features

**Installation Flexibility**
- Chatmodes only: Use GitHub Copilot chatmodes that embody agent personas
- Agents only: Direct agent invocation via prompt files for context-clean interactions  
- Both: Full flexibility to choose workflow based on task requirements

**Context Management**
- Automatic GitHub Copilot context loading for seamless AI assistance
- Structured instruction files for manual context access
- Command templates with built-in context loading specifications

**Workflow Optimization**
- Clear agent specialization and role definitions
- Systematic handoff protocols between agents
- Command-driven workflow execution with GitHub Copilot integration

**Developer Experience**
- Clean package distribution with user-focused README
- Comprehensive development documentation for contributors
- Extensive command library covering full development lifecycle

### Technical Details

**Package Structure**
- Clean separation between package files and development files
- Optimized file distribution (70KB package, 292KB unpacked)
- 70 total files including all agents, chatmodes, commands, and templates

**Architecture**
- Source agents in `assets/prompts/` → Installed to `.github/prompts/`
- Source chatmodes in `assets/chatmodes/` → Installed to `.github/chatmodes/`  
- Core system in `.ai-operator/` with commands, templates, and configuration
- Automatic GitHub integration through structured `.github/` files

**Quality Assurance**
- All file path references validated and corrected
- Content duplication issues resolved
- Installation process tested and verified
- Package creation and distribution validated

### Changed

**Workflow Optimization**
- Updated setup agent workflow to optimal sequence: Analysis → Copilot Instructions → Code Styles → Best Practices → Instruction Files
- Ensures instruction files are informed by comprehensive project analysis rather than generic templates
- Orchestrator chatmode now uses GPT-4.1 model for cost efficiency (simple workflow guidance doesn't require premium model)

**Enhanced Analysis Commands**
- `setup-generate-copilot-instructions.md`: **CRITICAL FIX** - Now performs actual codebase analysis instead of creating placeholder templates. Populates all sections (Project Overview, Technology Stack, Project Structure, Workflows) with real discovered information
- `setup-code-styles.md`: Analyzes actual codebase patterns to create language-specific style guides
- Identifies and suggests removing redundant pre-installed templates (e.g., .NET styles in JavaScript projects)  
- `setup-project-best-practices.md`: Documents actual project practices instead of copying generic templates
- All commands now create immediately useful, project-specific guidance based on real code analysis, not placeholder text
