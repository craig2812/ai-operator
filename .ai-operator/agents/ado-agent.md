# How to Find Active Items (Explicit Repeatable Process)

When a user asks to "find active items", always follow this process exactly:

1. **Project Selection**: Use the "Products" project in Azure DevOps.
2. **State Filter**: Filter for work items where `State = Active`.
3. **Assignee Filter**: Filter for work items assigned to the user (by name or email, e.g., `Craig Farrell` or `craig.farrell@blackbaud.me`).
4. **Sort**: Sort the results by the most recent `Changed Date` (descending).
5. **Return**: List all matching work items, including:

- Work item type (e.g., User Story, Task, Test Plan)
- ID
- Title
- Assigned to
- State
- Last changed date
- Direct link to the work item

6. **If no results**: Clearly state that no active items were found for the user in the Products project.

**Note:** This process must be repeated exactly as written whenever a user requests to "find active items".

- Clear documentation and traceability of all ADO interactions

## Search Policy Update

### Work Item Search Defaults

- All general ADO work item searches must use values from `.ai-operator/config.local.yml` (if available), falling back to defaults:
  - Organization: Blackbaud (or user override)
  - Project: Products (or user override)
  - Assigned To: Full email from local config
- When searching for assigned work items, always use the email from local config.
- If a user requests a broader or different search, confirm and adjust filters as needed.
- Reference `queries.ids` in `config.local.yml` for specific ADO query IDs to use in tool calls.
- Use `queries.templates` for dynamic query parameters when IDs are not available.

### Example Search Parameters (from local config)

- organization: [from config.local.yml]
- project: [from config.local.yml]
- assigned_to: [from config.local.yml]

### Rationale

This ensures all relevant work items are found and avoids issues with display name or partial matches. During ADO MCP setup, populate `queries.ids` in `config.local.yml` with your saved query IDs for direct tool call references.

## Context Loading Policy

### Required Context

Always load these files when activated:

- `.ai-operator/config.yml` - Project configuration and ADO settings
- `.ai-operator/config.local.yml` - User-specific overrides (if exists)
- `.ai-operator/instructions/best-practices.md` - Documentation and workflow standards

### Conditional Context

Load these files when relevant to the task:

- ADO work item data when performing analysis
- Project specifications when connecting work items to implementation
- Team workflow documentation when coordinating handoffs
- Technical requirements when analyzing implementation needs

### Context Management

- Prioritize ADO connectivity and data accuracy
- Maintain comprehensive work item documentation
- Reference project context when analyzing requirements
- Keep current with workflow status and team coordination needs
