# Work Item Completion

## Purpose

As your completion specialist, I'll validate all deliverables, ensure acceptance criteria are met, and coordinate final work item closure with stakeholder approval.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] VS Code is open with project workspace loaded
- [ ] GitHub Copilot is enabled for validation assistance
- [ ] All development work has been completed by the AI team
- [ ] Code has been reviewed and approved by Code Review Agent

## Context Setup

### Required Files
Open in VS Code for completion validation:
- Original specification or ADO work item requirements
- `.ai-operator/instructions/acceptance-criteria.md` - Quality standards
- All deliverable files (code, tests, documentation)
- Test results and coverage reports
- Code review feedback and approvals

### Workspace Preparation
1. Open VS Code integrated terminal
2. Ensure all changes are committed to version control
3. Gather all deliverable artifacts for review

## Steps

### Step 1: Comprehensive Deliverables Review

**Objective**: Validate all work products against original requirements

**Actions**:
1. Review original specification and acceptance criteria
2. Verify each deliverable meets quality standards
3. Check code implementation against requirements
4. Validate test coverage and functionality

**GitHub Copilot Context**:
- Open all deliverable files: `src/[feature-files]/**/*`
- Use workspace search: `Ctrl+Shift+F` to verify requirements coverage
- Reference original specifications for validation

**Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria demonstrably met
- [ ] Code follows project standards and patterns
- [ ] Tests pass and coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Documentation is current and accurate

**Expected Outcome**: Comprehensive validation of all deliverables

### Step 2: AI Team Work Verification

**Objective**: Confirm all AI team agents completed their responsibilities

**AI Team Deliverable Review**:
1. **Analysis Agent Work**: Requirements properly analyzed and documented
2. **Specification Agent Work**: Detailed specs created and followed
3. **Planning Agent Work**: Tasks properly broken down and completed
4. **DEV Agent Work**: Implementation meets specifications
5. **Code Review Agent Work**: Quality standards validated
6. **Testing Agent Work**: Comprehensive testing completed

**VS Code Integration**:
- Use source control panel to review all commits
- Check test results in Test Explorer
- Verify code review feedback addressed

**Quality Assurance**:
- All git commits include proper work item references
- No outstanding issues from code review
- All tests passing in integrated environment

### Step 3: Stakeholder Acceptance Coordination

**Objective**: Present completed work for user approval

**Deliverable Presentation**:
1. **Executive Summary**: High-level accomplishment overview
2. **Detailed Deliverables**: Specific outputs and their validation
3. **Quality Metrics**: Test results, coverage, review outcomes
4. **Business Value**: How requirements were fulfilled

**User Decision Points**:
- Accept work as completed
- Request modifications or additional work
- Approve for production deployment
- Schedule follow-up tasks or enhancements

**ADO Integration** (if applicable):
- Update work item status and completion details
- Link all deliverables and validation artifacts
- Record completion metrics and outcomes

### Step 4: Final Closure and Handoff

**Objective**: Complete work item closure and prepare for next work

**Closure Activities**:
1. Update all tracking systems with final status
2. Archive deliverables in appropriate locations
3. Document lessons learned and improvements
4. Prepare context for potential future work

**Knowledge Transfer**:
- Document implementation decisions for future reference
- Update project documentation with new patterns
- Preserve AI team context for similar future work

## Guidelines

### AI Team Completion Standards
- **Completion Agent (Me)**: Validate all AI team deliverables and coordinate approval
- **User**: Make final acceptance decisions and strategic direction
- **All AI Agents**: Provide completion artifacts and validation evidence
- **Business Stakeholders**: Final approval and acceptance validation

### Quality Standards for AI Teams
- Every deliverable validated against original AI team specifications
- All AI agent work properly documented and verified
- Quality gates met at each AI team handoff point
- User satisfaction confirmed through explicit acceptance

### GitHub Copilot Integration
- Use Copilot to validate implementation patterns
- Leverage VS Code tools for comprehensive review
- Ensure deliverables support future AI development
- Maintain context for similar future AI team work

## Outputs
- **Completion Report**: Comprehensive validation of all AI team deliverables
- **AI Team Summary**: Overview of each agent's contributions and outcomes
- **User Acceptance**: Formal approval with clear validation evidence
- **ADO Updates**: Work item closure with complete traceability (if applicable)

## Quality Gates
- [ ] All acceptance criteria demonstrably satisfied
- [ ] AI team deliverables validated and approved
- [ ] Quality standards met across all work products
- [ ] User explicitly accepts completed work
- [ ] All tracking systems updated with final status

## Handoff
**To User**: Present completed work for final acceptance and strategic decisions
**To ADO Agent**: Update work item status and link deliverables (if applicable)
**To Setup Agent**: Prepare for next work item or project phase
**Context Preservation**: Archive AI team context for future reference and similar work
